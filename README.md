# AxeMan
Final Exam for Android Development

How it works:

A welcome page welcomes the user. It has keeps counts on how many trees you have cut. After 5 seconds, a new screen will be displayed
showing a tree being cut down with an axe. To do this, the tree rotates to a fall direction. This is timed with the sound. The axe also spins
as if cutting the tree down.
